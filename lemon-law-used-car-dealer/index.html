<p>You can get “lemon law” relief when you buy a used car, too! The lemon law applies to used cars as long as the vehicle was covered by an express warranty when it was sold and as long as it was purchased at a retail dealer. Under the law of most states, for a vehicle to be considered a lemon, the car must 1) have a “substantial defect,” covered by warranty, that occurs within a certain time after. If your vehicle is a 2014 or earlier model year, and has no warranty, the likelihood is great that a lawyer cannot help you.</p>
