Mice Infestation Thanks To Negligent Landlord, what can I do? (TX) r From reddit.com
If your landlord asks you to move out for a short time, make sure you have somewhere to stay before you agree to it. As per the rental/lease agreement, before occupying and vacating, both the landlord and the tenants have to inspect the house or property and if there is any damage it. The landlord is required to take care of all of these things before the renter moves in, and the majority of the time once the tenant has moved in to maintain habitability. That said, there are several ways of doing so depending on when the damage occurs.
