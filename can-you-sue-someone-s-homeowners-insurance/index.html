Under california’s fair claims settlements practices regulations , property owners can bring a claim against their homeowner’s insurance carrier if the insurer acted in bad faith. In any case where someone’s negligence caused your injuries, you sue them directly, but other parties (like insurance companies) might still be involved in the suit. A standard florida homeowner’s policy covers the property itself and protects the property owner from personal injury lawsuits for specific negligent conduct on the premises. 7031 koll center pkwy, pleasanton, ca 94566.
